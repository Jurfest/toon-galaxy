# Toon Galaxy

Welcome to Toon Galaxy, an application to explore, search, and save your favorite cartoon characters. This project uses a monorepo structure managed with Nx, Angular for the frontend, and follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles

<!--
TODO: Add run structions
Development: npm run serve:ssr

Production: npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr:prod // Node Express server listening on http://localhost:4000

## Production Links

The Storybook for this project can be found at [design-insights.toongalaxy.toon](https://66739ea5b581c33ced2d5fbc-tgpcciyhjs.chromatic.com/).
TODO: production link.

Application Static Website Hosting (prerender) link: [toon-galaxy-s3-bucket](http://toon-galaxy.s3-website-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com)

Aplication Server Side Rendering link: [toon-galaxy]()

## Deploy

This application uses Server Side Rendering. Using prerendering, we can also deploy it
as with any static server (e.g., Apache Server, NGINX server or AWS S3 bucket).

For use all Server Side Rendering capabilities (hydration) in pages that can't use only
prerendering we need to deploy it to a Node server running in production.

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

### Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

### Start the application

Run `npx nx serve toon-galaxy` to start the development server. Happy coding!

### Build for production

Run `npx nx build toon-galaxy` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

### Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

### Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

### Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
