# Toon Galaxy

Welcome to Toon Galaxy, an application to explore, search, and save your favorite cartoon characters. This project uses a monorepo structure managed with Nx, Angular for the frontend, and follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

## Performance Metrics

### Web Core Vitals

https://web.dev/articles/vitals-measurement-getting-started?hl=en

Web Core Vitals are essential metrics that assess the loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability of web applications. These metrics are crucial for providing a good user experience.

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Optimal loading performance is achieved with LCP under 2.5 seconds.
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Measure related with interactivity. The target for optimal FID is less than 100 milliseconds.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Measure related to visual stability. Maintaining a CLS score of less than 0.1 helps avoid large unexpected layout shifts.

### Lighthouse Metrics

Lighthouse is a tool in Chrome Dev Tools for auditing and improving the quality of web pages. It provides insights into performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

### PageSpeed Insights

PageSpeed Insights analyzes the content of a web page and generates suggestions to make that page faster. It measures performance both on mobile and desktop devices.

### Additional Web Metrics

In addition to core metrics, consider other performance indicators such as:

- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Measures server response time.
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Measures when the page is usable and interactive.
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: Measures the total amount of time between First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI) where the main thread was blocked for long enough to prevent input responsiveness.

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

### Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

### Start the application

Run `npx nx serve toon-galaxy` to start the development server. Happy coding!

### Build for production

Run `npx nx build toon-galaxy` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

### Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

### Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

### Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.

<!-- Performance TODOS -->
<!--
// - Add relevant images to imagekit for performance improvement
// provideImageKitLoader('https://ik.imagekit.io/<key>'),

// - Add cache interceptor for first page empty search term list
