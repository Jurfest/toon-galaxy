# Toon Galaxy

Welcome to Toon Galaxy, an application to explore, search, and save your favorite cartoon characters. This project uses a monorepo structure managed with Nx, Angular for the frontend, and follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

## Application Insights and Performance Metrics

### Web Core Vitals

[Web Core Vitals metrics](https://web.dev/articles/vitals-measurement-getting-started?hl=en) assess the loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability of web applications. These metrics are crucial for providing a good user experience.

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Optimal loading performance is achieved with LCP under 2.5 seconds.
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Measures interactivity. The target for optimal FID is less than 100 milliseconds.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Measures visual stability. Maintaining a CLS score of less than 0.1 helps avoid large unexpected layout shifts.

### Performance Analysis Tools

Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights provide detailed analysis and insights into the performance of web applications.

#### Lighthouse Metrics

Lighthouse is a tool in Chrome DevTools for auditing and improving the quality of web pages. It provides insights into performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

#### PageSpeed Insights

[PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) analyzes the content of a web page and generates suggestions to make that page faster. It measures performance on both mobile and desktop devices.

### Real User Monitoring (RUM)

Real User Monitoring (RUM) captures performance metrics from actual users interacting with the site. This approach uses tools like PageSpeed Insights, Search Console, and the CrUX Dashboard to analyze performance under real-world conditions, providing insights that are directly relevant to user experience.

### Lab Data

Lab data tools, such as Lighthouse and WebPageTest, collect performance metrics in controlled environments. These tools help identify potential issues and validate changes before deploying them to production:

- **Lighthouse**: Generates comprehensive reports on LCP, CLS, and TBT, highlighting areas for performance improvement. Available in Chrome DevTools, as a Chrome extension, and as an npm package.
- **WebPageTest**: Provides detailed reports on web performance, useful for analyzing specific conditions such as different devices and network settings.

This combination of RUM and lab data ensures a holistic approach to performance optimization, addressing both real-world user experience and controlled environment testing.

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

### Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

### Start the application

Run `npx nx serve toon-galaxy` to start the development server. Happy coding!

### Build for production

Run `npx nx build toon-galaxy` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

### Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

### Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

### Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
